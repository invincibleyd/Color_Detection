CodeClause Task 1

## Color Detection Project

### Overview:
This project is a simple yet powerful color detection tool designed to extract and analyze dominant colors from images. Leveraging Python and popular image processing libraries, it provides an efficient way to identify key colors within an image.

### Features:
- **Color Extraction:** Utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to extract dominant colors from images.
- **Visual Representation:** Generates a visual representation of color palettes for easy interpretation.
- **Flexibility:** Can be applied to various image formats, making it versatile for different use cases.
- **Accuracy:** Employs robust color recognition techniques for accurate results.

### How to Use:
1. **Installation:**
    - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-detection.git`
    - Navigate to the project directory: `cd color-detection`
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Run the Code:**
    - Execute the main script: `python color_detection.py`
    - Input the path to your image when prompted.

3. **Interpret Results:**
    - View the generated color palette to identify dominant colors.
    - Explore the console output for detailed color information.

### Example:
```python
# Sample Usage
python color_detection.py -i path/to/your/image.jpg
```
